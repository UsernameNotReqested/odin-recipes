# odin-recipes
"Recipes" project from Odin Foundations section

Building a basic recipe website

Things to improve on:
    * Git commands
        - had to look up how to clone
    * Command line interaction
        - using 'touch' to create files
    * VS Code familiarity
    * Create templates for multiple use files

Ideas put into practice:
    * Establish repository in Git
    * Clone repo to local machine

Using Git:
    git status
    git add <file>
    git commit -m "<Message>"
    git log
